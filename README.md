# 16-QAM OFDM Wireless Communication Simulation

This project simulates a **16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)** based **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing)** communication system. It models all essential stages of the physical layer, including modulation, channel effects, equalization, and demodulation, complete with detailed visualizations.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Individual Simulation

To execute the 16-QAM OFDM simulation:

```bash
python 16qam_ofdm.py
```

This script will generate several `.png` plots and print the bit error rate at the end.

To execute other QAM OFDM simulations:

```bash
python 64qam_ofdm.py
python 256qam_ofdm.py
python 16qam_ofdm_image.py
python 16qam_ofdm_image_varying_snr.py
python 16qam_ofdm_image_varying_cyclic_prefix.py
python 16qam_ofdm_image_varying_subCarriers.py
```

These script will also generate several `.png` plots and print out many information.
